                Introduction to statistics
STATISTICS is the science of analyzing data. We can use the describe() function in Python to summarize the data:
PERCENTILES - We use this to take  a number that describes the value that a given percent of the values are lower than.
STANDARD DEVIATION - is a number that describes how spread out the values are.
VARIANCE - Variance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.
CORRELATION - Correlation measures the relationship between two variables.
A CORRELATION MATRIX - is simply a table showing the correlation coefficients between variables.

CORRELATION QUANTIFIES - I didn't really understand.
